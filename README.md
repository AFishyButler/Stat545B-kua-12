## Purpose
This repository was created to store a project for the Stat545B course at UBC. These assignments will help me practice and apply the concepts learned in lecture. 

Assignment B1 overviews creating a function in R, documenting it with roxygen2 tags, and testing it with expect_() functions.

To engage with this repository, open RStudio and run the code contained in the rmd files.

Files contained in this repository:
1. README.md: Contains information about the files and the project scope

2. Assignment_B1: rmd file working script; md file was the knitted file to a github document
